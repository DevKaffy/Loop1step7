            <p class="sex"><b>T</b>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even though most people don't take the time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for somthing much less than respect. I am convinced one of the best way to help relationship grow is by showing respect. </p>
            <p class="attention">I have come to the conclusion that everyone loves to be respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, base on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.</p>
